## Goal of the analysis

Visualizing timeseries of SARS CoV2-N1,N2 in Lift station samples, in comparison to their primary wastewater treatment plant. Data for N1, N2 and both replicate samples have been averaged before plotting.

Dates: March 2021 till 7-April-22

## Timeseries plots - Static

Y axis in units of copies per litre of WW

```{r all_plot}

all_plts <- map2(LS_WW_avg_nest$data, # map the plot for each primary wwtp
                 LS_WW_avg_nest$Primary_WWTP, # this is used for labelling the plots
  
    ~ plot_LS_time.series(.x) + 
      
      # for 69 and Sims Bayou that have many LS, change the colour scheme that can accomodate > 8 colours
      {if(str_detect(.$abbr_primary_wwtp %>% unique(), 'SB-merg|69')) scale_colour_viridis_d()} +
      
      # Add plot title
      ggtitle(.y)
      
)


# plotly::ggplotly(pltbox, dynamicTicks = TRUE)
